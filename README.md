# Activejob::Filtering

This is an [ActiveJob](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activejob) extension that allows to filter arguments in ActiveJob's log output.

Version: `0.1.0`. Tested on ruby `3.0.1`, rails: `~> 7.0.5`, activejob: `7.0.5`.

## If you using Rails >= 6.1

Rails >= 6.1 has the same features as this gem. In Rails you can disable log arguments to output like followings:

```ruby
class SensitiveJob < ApplicationJob
  self.log_arguments = false

  def perform(args)
  end
end
```

See PR: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37660

And PR: https://github.com/springerigor/rails/commit/02084de54d4b6c0c5861b33019a8f550b1e1ac84

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activejob-filtering', '0.1.0', github: 'pinifloyd/activejob-filtering'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Create file `config/initializers/activejob_filtering.rb` (you can skip this step as bellow you can see settings by default).

```ruby
ActiveJob::Filtering::Config.configure do |c|
  # Hide all arguments on any job. Same as a new feature log_arguments = false
  # in Rails >= 6.1. If false then gem will try to mask args if it possible
  # => [FILTERED].
  c.hide_arguments = false

  # Hash key where gem can find settings for any job.
  c.settings_key = :active_job

  # :nodoc
  c.filter_class = ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter

  # :nodoc
  c.filter_fields = Rails.application.config.filter_parameters
end
```

Define your job:

```ruby
class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(*args)
  end
end
```

And call defined job like followings:

```ruby
MyJob.perform_later(password: 'my-password', login: 'my-login')
```

Output example:

```
[ActiveJob] [MyJob] [ae3421c0-dcc7-4c3b-a741-ba06d8d68bf3] Performing MyJob (Job ID: ae3421c0-dcc7-4c3b-a741-ba06d8d68bf3) from Inline(default) enqueued at 2023-07-05T13:41:31Z WITH ARGS: {:password=>\"[FILTERED]\", :param_one=>\"some-param\"}
```

> IMPORTANT THING: gem works only with hash based args.

Invalid format:

```ruby
MyJob.perform_later('my-password', 'my-login')
```

Output example:

```
[ActiveJob] [MyJob] [e9bb4ca4-a1bb-4b03-a6e8-b67fb869c5d4] Performing MyJob (Job ID: e9bb4ca4-a1bb-4b03-a6e8-b67fb869c5d4) from Inline(default) enqueued at 2023-07-05T14:04:16Z [ERROR: WRONG FORMAT] CANNOT FILTER ARGS: ["my-password", "my-login"]
```
